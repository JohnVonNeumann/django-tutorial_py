#Django Tutorial

This is a repository that will be used for various Django tutorials, I may keep all the tuts in this repo for cleanliness and whatnot, this is my first repo in about a month. Started a new job recently (what is this? a blog?) so I've been very light on the (public) displays of engineering. This is an attempt to fix this. On the upside, I've learnt a hell of a lot over the past month including the ability to use Vim, albeit badly.
